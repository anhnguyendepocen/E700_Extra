### Part 0 ― Preliminaries

1. [The World of Mathematical Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1gT2f3Fe44) by Paul Lockhart, *if you want a small taste of why math-people like math in itself - and maybe you should too!*
2. [Understanding Mathematics](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math.html), a study guide by [Peter Alfeld](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/), *in case you feel lost.*
3. [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/playlists), *for exceptionally accessible videos on a wide range of topics.*
4. [Understanding Mathematics](https://github.com/nelson-brochado/understanding-math), *for more resources on the basics of understanding mathematics and its peculiarities.*

### Part 1 ― Foundations

**Cores**: sets, functions, relations, proofs and proof methods.

For a precise introductory treatment:

- [Basic Concepts of Mathematics](http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html) by Elias Zakon

For a more intensive discussion:

- [An Introduction to Set Theory](http://www.math.toronto.edu/weiss/set_theory.pdf) by William A. R. Weiss

---

> As a side note, know that E700 covers a number of topics and concepts which cast a wide web of mathematical tools ― many of which we must posses to understand modern economic theory and practice in detail. Thus all of the following resources have some degree of "intersection": you will find topics from one part also presented in a source listed for another part. 
>
> Use whichever resource you consider best *for your learning*. **This said, the material seen in class should *always* be the reference point.**

### Part 2 ― Spaces and Metrics

**Cores**: metric & normed spaces, convergence of sequences, continuity, compactness of sets.

These topics fall mostly under the umbrella of *topology*, and you can take a look at:

- [Understanding Analysis](http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/materias/verano2012/taller_de_calculo_avanzado/Libros/Abbott%20-%20Understanding%20Analysis.pdf) by Stephen Abbott - Chapters 2, 3, 4, *is the most accessible resource for this Part*.

- [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf) by Walter Rudin - Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4.

- [General Topology](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~pierre.schapira/lectnotes/Topo.pdf) - Chapters 1, 2, 3.
- [Modern Real Analysis](http://www.math.purdue.edu/~torres/pubs/Modern-real-analysis.pdf) - Chapter 3.
- [Real Analysis I](https://www.jirka.org/ra/realanal.pdf) - Chapters 2, 3.

For a more general overview (YouTube):

- [Abstract Vector Spaces](https://youtu.be/TgKwz5Ikpc8) *by 3blue1brown.*

---

### Part 3  ― Vectors and Matrices

**Cores**: vectors, matrix algebra, linear transforms, eigenvalues.

Rigorous treatment of *linear algebra* (vectors, matrices and related things) can be found in:

- [Linear Algebra](https://web.calpoly.edu/~jborzell/Courses/Year%2010-11/Fall%202010/Petersen-Linear_Algebra-Math_306.pdf) by Peter Petersen - Chapters 1, 2.
- [Linear Algebra](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/#current_version) by Jim Hefferon, *a very complete book*.

However because linear algebra is not always intuitive, especially in high dimensions, these resources are more accessible:

- [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW_2017-09-04.pdf)
- [Immersive Linear Algebra](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html), *an interactive web-book entirely on linear algebra.*

Videos (YouTube):

- [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) *by 3blue1brown.*

 ### Part 4 ― Differentiation and Optimization

**Cores**: multivariable differentiation, constrained/unconstrained optimization.

Regarding *differentiation* (this topic is also easily covered on Wikipedia, e.g.) take a look at:

- [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf) by Walter Rudin - Chapter 5.

- [The Calculus of Functions of Several Variables](http://www.synechism.org/wp/the-calculus-of-functions-of-several-variables/) - Chapters 2, 3.
- [Active Calculus (Multivariable)](https://activecalculus.org/ACM.html) 
- [Mathematics for Economists](https://primo.bib.uni-mannheim.de/permalink/f/19ojnqi/MAN_ALMA21119931390002561) - Part III.

While for *optimization* (in Economics we usually consider a pretty specific subset of optimization techniques) it is best to follow:

- [Mathematics for Economists](https://primo.bib.uni-mannheim.de/permalink/f/19ojnqi/MAN_ALMA21119931390002561) - Part IV.

Lastly, MIT Professor Gilbert Strang recorded masterful lectures on calculus, and you can find them (and the accompanying book) on MIT OpenCourseware:

-  [Calculus by G. Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/)

### Foreword

Two topics that are **not** covered in E700 are ***measure theory*** and ***integration***. By and large these are essential to understand most equations found in probability theory, statistics, macro and micro theory, and many more subfields. If you have a minimum of comfort with things like

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{100}&space;\LARGE&space;\int_{0}^{&plus;\infty}&space;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2&space;\pi}}&space;\,&space;e^{-x^2}&space;dx" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{80}&space;\LARGE&space;\int_{0}^{&plus;\infty}&space;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2&space;\pi}}&space;\,&space;e^{-x^2}&space;dx" title="\LARGE \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-x^2} dx" /></a>

then you should be fine.

However, good resources on these topics are:

- [Understanding Analysis](http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/materias/verano2012/taller_de_calculo_avanzado/Libros/Abbott%20-%20Understanding%20Analysis.pdf) by Stephen Abbott - Chapters 6, 7, *for a simple introduction to the Riemann integral*.

- [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf) by Walter Rudin - Chapters 6, 11.

- [An introduction to measure theory](https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf) by Terence Tao, *one of the great contemporary mathematicians.*
- [A Crash Course on the Lebesgue Integral and Measure Theory](https://www.gold-saucer.org/math/lebesgue/lebesgue.pdf)

Note that when you learn measure theory, you *also* learn *Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration*, which is the bedrock of modern probability theory - a skill you'll use forever!
